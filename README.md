# ChuniInputEmu
for use with ChuniInputServer

a piano app that sends the keys pressed over a websocket

Literally my first app ever :)


Features I'd like to add eventually:

Rewrite the ButtonSender so that it only sends data on piano key pressed, not continuously.

Add toggle for top row

Clean up code
